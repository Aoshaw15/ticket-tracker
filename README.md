## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Mongoose, JSON

I worked backwards through the MVC process by taking a template I used from previous projects(to-do, menuApp). Once I figured out the routes, models, and controllers, I used simple bootstrap structures to make an easy to follow way of creating a ticket that includes and issues a personal ID number generated by MongoDB to each new entry. The ticket also includes: an issue name, a description, severity options, who issued the ticket and whether or not the issue is "Open" or "Closed". I added some buttons to the bottom of each ticket to be able to close and/or delete the entry.  


## Lessons Learned:

This is more practice for MVC structure. It helps walking through each step to make sure everything is set up correctly. This was my first time using bootstrap, so there was a learning curve to make the site look the way I wnated it to using this particular templating language.
